### Styling

### Projects

Update the projects array in `src/app/page.tsx` with your own projects:

{
  title: 'Your Project',
  description: 'Project description',
  tech: ['Technology 1', 'Technology 2'],
}
```

### Skills

```typescript
{
  category: 'Category Name',
  icon: <Icon />,
  skills: ['Skill 1', 'Skill 2'],
}
```

### Resume Download

The resume download feature uses strategic placement for optimal UX:

1. **Header Navigation**: Persistent access across all pages
2. **Hero Section**: Primary call-to-action for visitors

To update your resume:
1. Replace `public/files/resume.pdf` with your resume
2. The filename will be `Wai_Si_Hnyun_Resume.pdf` when downloaded
3. Update the download filename in the components if needed

**Best Practice**: Keep only 2 download locations to avoid overwhelming users and maintain a clean, professional appearance.
